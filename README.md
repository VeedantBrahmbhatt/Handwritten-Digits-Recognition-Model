# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition-Model
Find MNIST Dataset usage with Neural Network for recognition of Handwritten digits.
In this Project usage of Librabries of python have been done which include Tensorflow,Keras,Seaborn,Numpy.
Progression of the project
--> importing dataset
--> splitting for test train sets
--> flattening of dataset with scaling it
--> creating a Neural Network 
--> Fitting Data 
--> Predicting Data 
--> optimizing accuracy
